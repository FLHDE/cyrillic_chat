# rus_chat

This is a reimplementation of the rus_chat plugin made by thiscall (OutCast) and DF which allows Cyrillic characters to be typed in the chat. The original implementation is often picked up by antiviruses as a false positive, making it not ideal for including it in mods. I based the implementation on a modified Freelancer.exe uploaded to the Freelancer Rebirth forum which had the feature hex-edited directly inside the binary.
